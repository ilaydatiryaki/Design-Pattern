# Design Pattern

#### 

Design Patterns are solutions created for common problems in software. They can be thought of as pre-made plans that you can customize and use to solve frequently encountered problems in the code. Design patterns are general concepts used for problem solving, not parts that you can find out-of-the-box like a function or class and add to your code.

The design pattern should not be confused with the algorithm. Algorithms are definitions of a clear set of actions that can achieve a goal. We can compare an algorithm to a recipe. The materials to be used and the steps to be followed are clearly defined. A design pattern, on the other hand, is more like a blueprint, in the end you will see the expected and features, but the order and form of implementation is a bit more up to you.
It is a subject within object oriented programming.

There are more than 250 known Design Patterns around the world. But 23 of them are used frequently.

Design Patterns are divided into 3 groups.

### Creational Patterns 

They are the structures that govern the creation of the object.

Factory Method, 
Abstract Factory Pattern, 
Singleton Design Pattern, 
Builder Design Pattern,
Prototype Design Pattern.  

### Structural Patterns 

They are structures that govern structures between objects.

Adapter Pattern, 
Facade Pattern, 
Decorator Pattern,
Bridge Pattern,
Composite Pattern,
Proxy Pattern,
Flyweight Pattern.

### Behavioral Patterns 

They are structures that affect and manage the structures of objects.

Command Pattern,
Iterator Pattern,
Mediator Pattern,
Null Object Pattern,
Strategy Pattern,
Visitor Pattern.
